<h3>
    html
</h3>
<p>
    There’s a lot going on here and every bit of it speaks to either the web browser, the reader or both. The “PUBLIC” part just speaks to the availability, the DTD stands for Document Type Definition, which declares the version of HTML being used and the final section is a URL pointing to where the DTD can be found.

<p>
    As you explore web development more, you’ll learn that there’s a huge emphasis on “standards-based development.” The general idea is that if we all follow certain rules and standards, web development will be a more cohesive and consistent practice. This is better for developers, better for browsers and most importantly, better for users.
</p>
<p>
    DOCTYPEs were originally designed to trigger “standards mode” in browsers, which meant that the page was rendered using newer web standards. Similarly, older pages without a DOCTYPE triggered “quirks mode” in browsers, which allowed for older practices to be used that wouldn’t function properly in standards mode.

<h3>
    css
</h3>
<p>
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language which is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup language. It provides an additional feature to HTML. It is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. It can also be used with any kind of XML documents including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
</p>
<p>
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

<h3>
    js 
</h3>
<p>
    JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
</p>
<p>

    JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices
</p>
<p>
    JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.
